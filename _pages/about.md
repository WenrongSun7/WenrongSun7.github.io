I'm a senior student of The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology(HKUST), majoring in Physics. I'm currently working with Prof [Tao Liu](https://physics.ust.hk/eng/people_detail.php?pplcat=1&id=38). In 2023 Summer, I have an opportunity to study as a summer student at CERN with Prof [Deepak Kar](https://atlas.cern/authors/deepak-kar).

<span style="color:blue">I am looking for a PHD position for particle physics in 2024 Fall!</span>


Research Interest
======
My research interests include High energy Physics Phenomenology and Cosmology. I am excited about to study the physics Beyond the Standard Model. Dark Matter modeling (WIMP, Axions, Dark Photons). CP violation and matter-antimatter asymmetry.
